## **1. Overview**

### **1.1 Objective**

Body Note is designed to help users track and visualize physical pain over time. The MVP will focus on a **picture-based tracking system** where users take daily photos of affected body parts, overlay past images for alignment, and mark pain areas using color-coded indicators. This allows for **trend analysis and a visual history** of pain progression to support self-awareness and medical consultations.

### **1.2 Key Benefits**

- **Simple & Fast Pain Tracking:** Take a picture, mark pain areas, and save.
- **Visual History of Pain Changes:** See how pain evolves over days/weeks.
- **Easy Doctor Communication:** Provides a structured pain history for medical discussions.

## **2. Features & Functionality**

### **2.1 Core Features (MVP Scope)**

### **Pain Tracking & Visualization**

- **Daily Photo Upload:** Users take a picture of the affected area.
- **Image Overlay for Alignment:** Semi-transparent overlay of the last image to maintain consistency.
- **Color-Based Pain Marking:** Users tap on the image to mark pain using **five color-coded indicators**, each representing a different type of pain:
    - **Red:** Sharp/Stabbing pain
    - **Blue:** Dull/Aching pain
    - **Yellow:** Burning pain
    - **Green:** Tingling/Numbness
    - **Purple:** Throbbing pain
- **Pain Intensity Selection:** Each color has **five levels of intensity** to indicate severity.

### **Pain Progression & Review**

- **Gallery View:** Users browse past entries to see pain evolution.
- **Basic Trends:** Simple visual indicators of pain progression over time.

### **Data Management & Export**

- **Local & Cloud Storage:** Save pain entries securely.
- **Export to PDF:** Users generate a simple pain report for doctors.

## **3. Technical Approach**

### **3.1 Platform (MVP Decision: Web App First)**

- **Web App First:** Faster to develop using React + Supabase/Firebase.
- **Mobile App Later:** Possible React Native expansion for deeper camera integration.

### **3.2 AI & Image Processing (Future Enhancements, Not MVP)**

- **AI-Assisted Pain Pattern Recognition:** Post-MVP feature.
- **Auto-Alignment of Photos:** Potential use of OpenCV.js for better image consistency.

## **4. User Experience (UX) Considerations**

- **Fast Entry Flow:** Take a picture → Mark pain → Save.
- **Intuitive UI:** Simple interface with large tap areas for marking pain.
- **Guided Onboarding:** Short tutorial on how to use overlays and pain markers.
